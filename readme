Simple Prestashop PHPscript to fix random images ID when you upload products images.

This script was creating to quickly resolve a prestashop theme bug : products images were suppose to change on hover but second image shown was missing.
The main issue was the images ID was totally randomized when they was imported by CSV.

To run the script, just put it in a custom folder on your FTP, change and adapt credentials and voil√† :)
